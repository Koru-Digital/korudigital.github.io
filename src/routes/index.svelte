  <h2>Hi, I'm Glenn.</h2>
  <p>I'm a front end web developer with over 14 years industry experience.</p>
  <p>I've worked with PR agencies, web agencies as well as in-house in a range of roles.</p>
  <p>I'm based near Bristol in the West of England, however am only considering fully remote work at this time.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>What I can do for you</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>I've specialised in Drupal site building and theming for over 14 years, and am able to turn my hand to back end work as necessary.</li>
    <li>Equally happy working as part of a team or left to my own devices, I'm happy problem solving or pairing with others.</li>
    <li>I've experience mentoring and teaching, having interviewed and hired apprentices, and helped them on their journey towards becoming developers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why Koru</h2>
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koru">Koru</a> is a MƒÅori word, symbolising new life, growth, strength and peace. Being from New Zealand, I thought this was a fitting emblem, with no small amount of significance. There's a koru on the bone carving I wear too.</p>
